Have not figured out a good way to install, but am working on it.

Problem:  when boinc starts up the Milkyway locality server senses a different executable at
	C:\ProgramData\BOINC\projects\milkyway.cs.rpi.edu_milkyway>
It will replace it with the current one from the project.  This means you cannot just
rename your mod to use the same name as the Milkyway app.

Temporary work-arond

1.  If you copy the apps you built the directory listing should look like the following

 Directory of C:\ProgramData\BOINC\projects\milkyway.cs.rpi.edu_milkyway

12/26/2019  03:54 PM           791,412 lua.exe
11/29/2019  07:48 PM         1,184,768 milkyway_1.46_windows_x86_64__opencl_ati_101.exe
12/26/2019  03:54 PM         6,204,928 milkyway_nbody.exe
12/27/2019  02:31 AM         1,583,104 milkyway_separation.exe

2. Suspend the Milkyway project
3. Save the original app and COPY the new app to the same nanme as the original

ren milkyway_1.46_windows_x86_64__opencl_ati_101.exe milkyway_1.46_windows_x86_64__opencl_ati_101_orig.exe
copy milkyway_separation.exe milkyway_1.46_windows_x86_64__opencl_ati_101.exe

============warning===========

you will have to repeat the copy operation every time the system reboots or if you stop and start the boinc client.
